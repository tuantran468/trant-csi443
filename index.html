    <h3>Bio:</h3> Hi, my name is Tuan Tran and I am currently attending Renton Technical College to get my Bachelor Degree in software development. I am currently a full-time employee and a part time student. I plan on getting a job relating to my degree once I graduate.  What I am excited to learn about this class is more CSS and html coding. I have done CSS and Html webpages before, but not really much about making it responsive to different type of platform.
